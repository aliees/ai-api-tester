# UI/UX Redesign Plan: API Tester

## 1. Vision

The new design for the API Tester page will be professional, modern, and highly usable, reflecting the standards of a top-tier technology company. The interface will be clean, intuitive, and fully responsive, with a minimalist black and white theme to ensure elegance and focus on functionality.

## 2. Theme and Color Palette

The design will adhere to a strict black and white color palette to maintain a clean and sophisticated aesthetic.

| Link Hover              | Dark Grey             | `#333333`         |

## 3. Layout and Responsiveness

The API Tester will feature a responsive two-column layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

*   **Desktop (Screens > 768px):**
    *   A two-column layout will be used.
    *   **Left Column:** Contains the API request form (`ApiForm.tsx`).
    *   **Right Column:** Contains the test cases list, results display, security analysis, and recommendations.
    *   A subtle border will separate the two columns.

*   **Mobile & Tablet (Screens <= 768px):**
    *   The layout will stack into a single column.
    *   The order of elements will be:
        1.  API Request Form
        2.  Test Cases List
        3.  Results Display
        4.  Security Analysis & Recommendations

*   **Breakpoint:** The transition from a two-column to a single-column layout will occur at a screen width of **768px**.

## 4. Component Redesign

### 4.1. Navigation Header

*   **Style:** A clean, fixed header at the top of the page.
*   **Content:** The title "API Tester".
*   **Styling:**
    *   `padding`: 20px
    *   `border-bottom`: 1px solid `#E0E0E0`

### 4.2. API Request Form (`ApiForm.tsx`)

*   **Layout:** A single-column form with clear labels above each input field.
*   **Input Fields:**
    *   Modern, flat design with a light grey border.
    *   On focus, the border will turn black.
    *   Generous `margin-bottom` for spacing.
*   **Buttons:**
    *   The "Generate Tests" button will be styled as the primary interactive element.
    *   It will be full-width to be easily tappable on mobile devices.

### 4.3. Test Cases & Results (`TestCasesList.tsx`, `ResultsDisplay.tsx`)

*   **Container:** Both the test cases and results will be displayed within cards with a light grey border and subtle box shadow to lift them off the page.
*   **Test Cases List:**
    *   A clean, ordered list of generated test cases.
    *   The "Run Tests" button will be prominently displayed above the list.
*   **Results Display:**
    *   The results will be organized into collapsible accordions for "Response," "Headers," and "Logs."
    *   This keeps the interface clean and allows the user to focus on the information they need.
    *   JSON and other code snippets will be displayed in a monospace font for readability.

### 4.4. Visual Hierarchy

The design will use typography and spacing to create a clear visual hierarchy.

*   **Headings:** `h1`, `h2`, etc., will be used for section titles.
*   **Spacing:** Consistent padding and margins will be used throughout the application to ensure a balanced and uncluttered layout.
