# AI-Powered API Tester

This project is a web-based API testing tool that leverages artificial intelligence to automatically generate test cases. It is designed to simplify the API testing process by allowing users to input an API's details and receive a comprehensive set of test cases, including positive, negative, and edge cases. The application then allows the user to execute these tests and view a detailed report of the results.

The primary goal of this tool is to accelerate the testing cycle and improve test coverage by automating the often time-consuming task of writing test cases.
