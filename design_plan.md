# UI/UX Design Plan

This document outlines the UI/UX design plan for the application overhaul. It includes a design system with a color palette, typography, and layout principles, along with a high-level plan for implementation.

## 1. Research and Inspiration

Modern developer tools and SaaS applications prioritize clarity, efficiency, and a clean aesthetic. Key trends include:

*   **Dark Mode by Default:** Many developer tools (like VS Code, Postman) offer a dark theme as the default, which is often preferred for reducing eye strain during long work sessions.
*   **Minimalist Interface:** Clean layouts with ample white space help users focus on the core tasks.
*   **Accent Colors for Actionable Items:** Bright, contrasting colors are used for primary buttons, links, and other interactive elements to guide the user.
*   **Clear Information Hierarchy:** Using typography (size, weight) and color to distinguish between different levels of information is crucial.
*   **Consistent Iconography:** A consistent set of icons improves usability and makes the interface more intuitive.

## 2. Design System

### 2.1. Color Palette

*   **Primary:** `#6C63FF` (A vibrant purple for primary actions and highlights)
*   **Secondary:** `#3F3D56` (A dark, muted purple for backgrounds and secondary elements)
*   **Accent:** `#FF6584` (A bright pink for accents and alerts)
*   **Neutral (Dark):** `#2F2E41` (Dark background color)
*   **Neutral (Light):** `#F5F5F5` (Light text and foreground color)
*   **Success:** `#5CB85C`
*   **Error:** `#D9534F`

### 2.2. Typography

*   **Font Family:** `Inter`, a clean and modern sans-serif font. A common fallback will be `sans-serif`.
*   **Headings (h1, h2, h3):**
    *   `h1`: 32px, Bold
    *   `h2`: 24px, Bold
    *   `h3`: 18px, Semi-Bold
*   **Body Text:** 16px, Regular
*   **Labels/Subtext:** 14px, Regular

### 2.3. Layout Principles

*   **Grid System:** A 12-column grid system will be used for consistent alignment of components.
*   **Spacing:** A base unit of 8px will be used for margins and padding (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px). This creates a consistent rhythm throughout the application.
*   **Border Radius:** A consistent border-radius of 4px will be used for buttons, inputs, and cards to maintain a modern, slightly rounded look.

## 3. High-Level Implementation Plan

The new design system will be applied to the following components:

*   **Navigation:** The main navigation bar will use the `Secondary` color as a background, with the `Primary` color highlighting the active link.
*   **Forms & Inputs:** Input fields will have a `Neutral (Dark)` background with a `Neutral (Light)` border. On focus, the border will change to the `Primary` color.
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **Primary Buttons:** `Primary` background color with `Neutral (Light)` text.
    *   **Secondary Buttons:** `Secondary` background color with `Neutral (Light)` text.
*   **Results Display:** The results area will use a `Neutral (Dark)` background. Syntax highlighting will be used for code snippets, and success/error messages will use the respective `Success` and `Error` colors.
*   **Cards & Containers:** Cards will have a `Secondary` background color with a subtle border.
