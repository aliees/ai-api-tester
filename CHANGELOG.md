# Changelog

This document outlines the recent changes made to the AI-Powered API Tester project to improve its functionality and resolve issues.

## Feature Enhancements

Based on the initial task list, the following features were implemented to make the test case generation more intelligent and context-aware.

### 1. Enhanced AI Microservice to Fetch Sample Response
- **Added `requests` library**: The `ai-microservice/requirements.txt` file was updated to include the `requests` library, enabling the service to make HTTP requests.
- **Fetch Sample Response**: The `ai-microservice/app.py` was modified to make a `GET` request to the user-provided API URL. This fetches a real-time sample response from the target API.

### 2. Improved AI Prompt with Real Data
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: The prompt sent to the OpenAI API in `ai-microservice/app.py` was updated to include the fetched sample response. This provides the AI with concrete data, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant test cases based on the actual API output.

### 3. Updated Project Documentation
- **Reflected New Logic**: The `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` file was updated to reflect the new, smarter test generation logic in the "AI Microservice" and "Data Flow" sections.

## Bug Fixes

During the implementation and testing process, several issues were identified and resolved:

1.  **Python Command Errors**:
    - Resolved `pip: command not found` by using `pip3`.
    - Resolved `flask: command not found` by using the `python3 -m flask run` command, which is a more reliable way to run the application.

2.  **Connection Error (`ECONNREFUSED`)**:
    - The backend was unable to connect to the AI microservice because the Flask app was running on the default port (`5000`) instead of the expected port (`5001`).
    - **Fix**: Restarted the Flask application using the `--port 5001` flag to ensure it runs on the correct port.

3.  **Python `UnboundLocalError`**:
    - The application crashed with a `local variable 'json' referenced before assignment` error. This was due to the `json` library being imported inside a `try` block.
    - **Fix**: Moved the `import json` statement to the top of `ai-microservice/app.py` to ensure it is globally available.

4.  **OpenAI `context_length_exceeded` Error**:
    - When testing with APIs that return large responses, the AI microservice would fail because the prompt exceeded OpenAI's maximum token limit.
    - **Fix**: Implemented logic in `ai-microservice/app.py` to truncate the sample API response to a maximum of 4000 characters before including it in the prompt. This prevents the error while still providing sufficient context to the AI.
